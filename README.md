# PHYS598_Computation_in_Astrophysics
- Familiarized with the use of a computer to solve diverse problems in physics including fluid dynamics problems.  
- Numerical methods: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), ordinary / partial differential equations, Monte Carlo integration and simulation methods, linear equations and matrices.  
- Physical systems and equations: Hydrodynamic equations and shock waves, diffusion and heat conduction equations, Maxwell's equations, dynamical chaos.  

##Acknowledgement:  
The implementation and header files provided in Numerical Recipes are used extensively in the codes within this repository to perform scientific calculations. Those files can be found easily so I am not including those files here.
